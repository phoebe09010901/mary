<p>Hi <span style="color:#F00">Name</span>,</p>
<p>This is Mary, the founder of Adopt a Doggie, rescuer and foster mom of many deserving dogs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you for your application to adopt <span style="color:#F00">Dog&rsquo;s Name</span>.  Please make sure that you have included your home photos with your application as we pre-approve all homes before adoption.  If you have not, please email a few photos of your home, yard, family, pets, and front of the house photos to <a href="mailto:adoptions@adoptadoggie.org">adoptions@adoptadoggie.org</a> for us to process your application.  </p>
<p>We are an international rescue group dedicated to help any dogs in need of a good home.  Some of our doggies are available for meet and greet while others doggies are being fostered abroad.  <span style="color:#F00">Dog&rsquo;s Name</span> is still being fostered abroad.  I know it is hard for you to commit before meeting the dog, but we have many loving families who understand the horrible situations in Asia.  All dogs are placed in experienced foster homes and we provide temperament tests before posting any dogs for adoption.  The only reason why we help with these poor dogs is because in Asia many people live in tiny apartments, work over 12 hours a day, and dogs are not treated as family members.  These dogs will never have a chance to survive and being in a home.  </p>

<p>Every month we have 3-4 flights coming from Taiwan to San Francisco.  Our next flight is arriving on <span style="color:#F00"><strong><u>January 1, Thursday</u></strong></span>.  All the families that adopt our doggies abroad will pick up the dog at the SFO International airport.  Our volunteers will be at the airport to assist you and your family.</p>
<p>We do have a 30 days adjustment period.  In any case the dog is not a good fit, we have a boarding facility where you can return the dog.  We have never had to send a dog back to Taiwan.  We will re-home the dog locally.  However, this seldom happen as we are very experienced with dogs and all dogs are placed in good foster homes after being rescued.   </p>

<p>The Collared Scholar&nbsp;– Poway, CA – In an&nbsp;interview with Fox 5 news San Diego, The Collard Scholar president Megan Karnes says of the Taiwanese dogs – &ldquo;To stay in our shelters would be like staying in the Hilton compared to where they are coming from.&rdquo; </p>
