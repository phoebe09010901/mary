performed.  This Agreement is only intended for a Rescue Dog where such operation has not already been successfully performed.
Adopt a Doggie believes in responsible adoption practices and will not allow dogs that have no proof of a successful spay or neuter
operation to be adopted through Adopt a Doggie to help control the pet population in North America.  By this Agreement, the Adopter
hereby  agrees  to  have  a  gender-appropriate  spay  or  neuter  operation  performed  on  the  Rescue  Dog  through  an  appointment
scheduled  by  the  Rescuer  and/or  Adopt  a  Doggie.    Adopter  agrees  to  provide  written  veriﬁcation  of  the  Rescue  Dog’s  successful
spay/neuter operation by the Adopt a Doggie selected veterinarian to the Rescuer or Adopt a Doggie within fourteen (14) days of the
scheduled appointment. It is the responsibility of the Adopter, not the veterinarian; to ensure Adopt a Doggie is provided with and has
received the written veriﬁcation. In the event Adopter breaches the Spay/Neuter Agreement, the Adopter agrees to return the Rescue
Dog to Adopt a Doggie, including providing transportation, and understands the adoption fee will not be refunded.  </span></td>

of ownership to any ﬁrm, corporation, or organization such as another rescue group, research facility or shelter without AAD’s express
written consent. The Adopter further agrees to not otherwise abandon the Rescue Dog.  If in the unlikely event the Adopter no longer
wants to retain ownership and care for the Rescue Dog, the Adopter agrees to return the Rescue Dog to Adopt a Doggie or the Rescuer.
Adopt a Doggie and/or Rescuer will take appropriate and reasonable steps to assist the Adopter if a concern arises with the Rescue Dog
and his or her ability to permanently stay with Adopter.  The Adopter hereby understands and agrees that a violation of the Agreement
Not to Transfer Ownership may result in the Adopter being responsible for any and all related court costs, attorney fees or any other

agrees that the Rescue Dog shall reside in the Adopt a Doggie-approved home, and live as a family member and companion only.
Adopt a Doggie does not recommend keeping the Rescue Dog outdoors while no one is at the Adopter’s home, or at any other time
left alone outdoors while the Adopter is not at home. If the Adopter chooses to ignore this provision, the Adopter does so at his or her
own  risk  and  accepts  the  responsibility  if  the  Rescue  Dog  runs  away,  escapes,  or  is  otherwise  lost  or  injured.    Adopt  a  Doggie
recommends and expects the Rescue Dog may be conﬁned to a room such as a bedroom, or any other room of adequate size with
access to food and water, if necessary and appropriate, and is protected from the elements of weather. The Adopter agrees not to
expose the Rescue Dog to harmful objects, poisons, other living creatures, or situations that may endanger the Rescue Dog's life or
well-being. The Rescue Dog should be crated for no longer than eight (8) hours in a twenty-four (24) hours period. The crate must be
large enough for Rescue Dog to lie comfortably on its side. Adopt a Doggie believes that an outside shelter, such as a doghouse, is not
acceptable as residence, but may be used only when needed in extreme heat, cold, or rain when the Rescue Dog is allowed in an Adopt
a Doggie-approved fenced backyard for short periods of time and only when the Adopter is at home.  </span></td>

Dog will be seen by a veterinarian of Adopter’s choosing and cost, to begin the heartworm preventative program and to get a fecal test
performed to ensure the Rescue Dog is free of parasites. Rescuer reserves the right to contact Adopter’s veterinarian at any time to verify
that all the basic health requirements have been performed.  The Rescue Dog, regardless of the age at the time of adoption, shall: (1)
remain on heartworm preventative indeﬁnitely throughout the entire lifespan of the Rescue Dog, and (2) have yearly booster shots of
DA2PP and Bordatella, with all costs to be the responsibility of the Adopter.  Rescuer reserves the right to verify with the Adopter's
veterinarian that the heartworm preventative has been purchased, that the Rescue Dog has a yearly blood test for this purpose and that
Rescue Dog’s yearly vaccinations are current. In addition, the Adopter agrees to provide the Rescue Dog with any other medications or
rabies vaccine or other vaccine(s) that are required by law where the Adopter resides.  Adopt a Doggie strongly recommends Adopter

conditions of physical or temperament changes that may occur. Rescuer will provide Rescue Dog with basic vaccines and spay/neuter
operation of the adopted dogs prior to adoption, if the age and current health of the Rescue Dog permits. While the Rescuer makes
every eﬀort to place only healthy animals, the Rescuer cannot guarantee the health of any animal, and is not held responsible for any
medical expenses incurred by the Adopter after adoption. The Adopter understands and is aware of all behavioral or temperament of
Rescue Dog as described by the Rescuer or the Adopt a Doggie website. The Adopter agrees to continue to work with the Rescue Dog.
Adopt  a  Doggie  and/or  Rescuer  will  attempt  to  work  with  Adopter  if  a  concern  arises  with  the  Rescue  Dog’s  health  and/or
