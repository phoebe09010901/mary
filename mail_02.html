<p>Hi <span style="color:#F00">Name</span>,</p>
<p>This is Mary, the founder of Adopt a Doggie, rescuer and foster mom of many deserving dogs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you for your application to adopt <span style="color:#F00">Dog&rsquo;s Name</span>.  Please make sure that you have included your home photos with your application as we pre-approve all homes before adoption so that when you decide to adopt on the day of visit, you will be able to bring the dog home with you.  If you have not, please email a few photos of your home, yard, family, pets, and front of the house photos to <a href="mailto:adoptions@adoptadoggie.org">adoptions@adoptadoggie.org</a> for us to process your application.  Please call Brad Tanner at 415-683-3535 to schedule a time to meet the doggies.</p>
<p>We are an international rescue group dedicated to help any dogs in need of a good home.  Some of our doggies are available for meet and greet while others doggies are being fostered abroad.  </p>

<p><strong>Adoption Agreement:        </strong><br />
  On the day of adoption, we will ask you to sign an adoption agreement.  There will be an adoption fee of US$399 (minus a $50 rebate upon completion of your initial (FREE) training/obedience session with our trainer within the first 2 months of adoption).&nbsp;&nbsp;All dogs are spayed &amp; neutered, microchip, up to date with vaccinations &amp; rabies shot, de-wormed and given heartworm preventative and flea medication every month.&nbsp;&nbsp;We will provide the dog&rsquo;s medical record for your reference.&nbsp; <br />
   <br />
  Once you adopt a dog from Adopt a Doggie, K9 Cooperhaus will&nbsp;offer one hour free group training consultation (<a href="http://www.cooperhaus.com/">www.cooperhaus.com</a>).&nbsp; Brent Cooper is the most effective trainer who we work with closely.&nbsp; Please make an appointment with Brent Cooper for the training course after the dog settles in your home.&nbsp;You will receive a $50 rebate when you attend a training session with our trainer within the first two months of adoption. </p>
<p>Thank you for your considerations and giving a rescued dog a loving home.</p>
<p>Looking forward to hearing back from you soon!&nbsp; </p>
<p>All the best, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
